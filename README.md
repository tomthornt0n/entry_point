# Entry Point - A Template for starting new C projects
This is not intended to be used as a library, separate from the custom code.
It is instead intended to be a template for new projects, containing a selection of code which is common amongst many codebases.
In some places, features are left intentionally uncomplete, with the intention of them being modified to suit the specific project - e.g. the windowing system makes no effort to create a graphics context of any kind.
